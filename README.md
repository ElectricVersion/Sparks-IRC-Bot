# Sparks-IRC-Bot
Just a little IRC bot I'm making. Uses SFML.

I honestly have no idea what I'm doing. I've never used github before and I'm a terrible programmer.
The reasons I'm uploading this are primarily:
1. So that if my laptop dies, I can retrieve it
2. So that people can see the code, and if there's anything useful in it, do as they like with it.
